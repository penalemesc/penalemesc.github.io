                                CampusCare is a website developed by <b>Team ACME</b>, composed by <b>A</b>nika
                                Rajbhandary, <b>M</b>ustafe Osman, <b>C</b>onrado Pe√±a Lemes (me!)
                                and <b>E</b>lla Visconti, who are students of CS 344 - Human Computer Interactions
                                at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, United States of America. <br> The goal of
                                the website is to centralise mental health and wellness
                                resources at Carleton as they are not always easy to access and even when they are easy
                                to access, students might not know they are available
                                since there are multiple websites that handle all different parts of the resources
                                available here at Carleton. <br> As such Team ACME's goal is to
                                have at the very least an easy way to access all the different resources that might be
                                available such as counseling sessions, the SWA dogs,
                                religious services, etcetera. <br><br>
                                From interviewing two potential users of the website, the most relevant things that I
                                learnt that lead me to create the low fidelity prototype that can be
                                found on this page are that one of the things that the website needs to have for sure is
                                a subpage that has
                                all available resources at Carleton that pertain to mental health, page in which one
                                could look for vaguely what resource they want access to and the
                                page will provide what it thinks you are looking for. The other thing I learn is that
                                there should be some specific resources when one opens the page
                                particularly those that help first gen students and international students, since they
                                are the most likely to be affected by lack of information
                                in regards to the available resources at school.

                            As can be inferred from the previous paragraph our project went through a couple iterations
                            of research, we each conducted 2 interviews, mainly they were semi-structured interviews,
                            however some of us decided to use fictional inquiry, for a total of 10 interviews.
                            These reason why I decided to use semi-structured interviews is because even if there is an
                            outline that was created before them that I mostly followed,
                            this outline was created with the idea in mind that we (as interviewers) would stray from
                            the outline and allows for more or different questions to be asked based off what the
                            interviewees answered.
                            These interviews where then used to create a codebook which can be found <a
                                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1toB4XXmeew5NoEOCJIe6C46lZ4W6x21atgiLAaFYGDo/edit?usp=sharing"
                                class="blue">here</a>,
                            this codebook was used to then <abbr
                                title="research technique in which relationships between categories and codes are analysed">axial-code</abbr>
                            the interviews. This initial axial-coding helped us create the
                            affinity diagram that you can see in this section which has the different codes that we all
                            individually thought that the page should have. Thus from this affinity diagram we were able
                            to create a codebook that
                            we used to make a final round of axial-coding with.
                            The reason for why we had so many steps is that from this final axial-coding we were able to
                            generate the main requirements that our website has, which then influenced the way that we
                            would create our next individual prototypes.

                                Now you may be wondering, <b>what are our main requirements then?</b><br>
                                Well I am glad you asked, I will only talk about the ones that we as a time decided were
                                the 3 most important and thus we all individually used
                                to create our own version 2 prototypes for the website. <br>

                                <li>Counseling options/Scheduling: List of counseling options and how to schedule them
                                    since students are not fully aware on how to.
                                    In this case we mention the need to provide a step by step list however I decided
                                    that for my prototype I wanted to show an option in which
                                    the student access an item on the navigation bar and when selecting a day all the
                                    possible options appear since I believe that while we might not be able
                                    to accomplish this in the amount of time that we have available for this project,
                                    because of the second requirement and because
                                    this is a prototype design I wanted to explore a different approach that could be
                                    implemented by the college in the future
                                    or by us where we to continue working on this project.

                                to those inquiries. I decided to add a search bar to the design*, because based off of
                                the interviews there is a lot of topics
                                that there might be misconceptions off and thus a lot of questions that might need
                                answering.

                                do not know which office it belongs to, this page has a search function<a

                                Continuing, while I believe that the best way to know how my prototype addresses those
                                requirements is to explore it (<b>Tip:</b> if you press anywhere in the window that

                            For the final prototype, a UX Evaluation was conducted through the co-discovery method, in
                            which 2 potential future users
                            were asked to verbalise all of their thoughts as they explored the website. Be it what they
                            are doing, what they think about doing,
                            what they think of the organisation of the website, etc. They were asked to do a series of
                            tasks, portrayed in the table next to this text,
                            during which I recorded the different metrics that we (Team ACME) decided were interesting
                            for our respective prototypes.
                            <br>
                            Additionally once the tasks were completed I asked the users to vocalise their thoughts on
                            the website, both things that worked and things that did not including things that they wish
                            were on the website.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            There were a couple of things that worked and not from this prototype based on what the
                            users said, the next couple of sentences include quotes from the
                            2 users that participated in the evaluation, to preserve their privacy only the quote will
                            be written without a citation to whom said it.

                        <div> <!-- class="col-sm-8" -->

                                The main thing that I found was that the footer was semi-useful but not really liked by
                                the
                                users ‚ÄúSo usually I don't the footer is like, not stuck to the bottom of a page.‚Äù
                                ‚ÄúI have very bad eyesight, just in general, and even with my contacts, it's kind of I'm
                                especially straining on the emergency resources and commonly asked questions.‚Äù
                                At one point towards the end one user even mentioned "I mean, we've already talked a lot
                                about the footer and how we both feel"
                                This made it so that a partial redesign of the footer was made, in which the footer was
                                first made to not be stuck and also make the text bigger so that it can be better read
                                by people with poor eyesight, the reorganisation of information was left for future
                                work.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                On the other hand, the homepage was liked by the users quite a bit ‚ÄúAnd I feel as though
                                the
                                carousel works a lot better for what this is trying to achieve, just because there's so
                                many resources that you guys are putting into one area.‚Äù
                                ‚ÄúAnd it's like, really in your face, which I really like, you don't have too much.‚Äù
                                As such not many changes were made, mostly the addition of an actually working carousel
                                with images and working buttons
                            </p>

                            There were a couple of other recommendations that the users presented for the site which
                            were taken into account and modified accordingly (such as the separation of appointments
                            into medical, therapy and case management), however these are better seen by exploring
                            the
                            site in the prototype that can be seen next to this text or <a

                            that
                            will be mentioned, though, is the inclusion of colours and images to the whole site as
                            it was lacking
                            beforehand, where I used the <a

                            lighter shade that I liked for the other states. Additionally even if this project was
                            created for Carleton College, in order to comply with copyright,

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Whilst not mentioned by my users, users of other Team ACME Prototypes mention that a
                        profile button where one could access medical records and appointments could be good to have
                        on the site, however at the time of this writing I did not implement it to my design since my
                        users did not mention it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reorganisation of the site as a whole would be good to do as at this point the only part that is
                        organised is the
                        home page carousel, everything else was added as I went and thus there is no explicit system
                        that organises it (other than them being on the specific pages they are supposed to be),
                        which is contingent with the time constraints I had for this project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Additionally having the search bars actually work in their respective pages would be best, as at
                        this time they are still just a presentation aspect as it was really hard to implement in Figma.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The last future
                        work thing that I will mention is the fact that in the Q&A Section, the last answer
                        is not visible and if you press on it again the bottom line for the box will be missing, I am
                        unsure why this is, however in the previous prototype that worked and the reason for
                        that was that the footer was always on top so in reality what moved was the inside
                        section,
                        in this prototype (because users asked for it) the footer nor the header are sticky and
                        this creates this issue which I was not able to solve due to time constraints so that is
                        the last thing left to future work</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To conclude, working on this project was really fun to do as we got to explore all the different aspects
                    that go into software/website design, whether it be the evaluations, the prototyping, etc. It essentially
                    provided a peek into how to the whole process is like and thus I appreciate the opportunity to work
                    on it quite a bit
