                                CampusCare is a website developed by <b>Team ACME</b>, composed by <b>A</b>nika Rajbhandary, <b>M</b>ustafe Osman, <b>C</b>onrado Pe√±a Lemes (me!)
                                and <b>E</b>lla Visconti, who are students of CS 344 - Human Computer Interactions
                                at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, United States of America. <br> The goal of the website is to centralise mental health and wellness
                                resources at Carleton as they are not always easy to access and even when they are easy to access, students might not know they are available
                                since there are multiple websites that handle all different parts of the resources available here at Carleton. <br> As such Team ACME's goal is to 
                                have at the very least an easy way to access all the different resources that might be available such as counseling sessions, the SWA dogs, 
                                religious services, etcetera. <br><br>
                                From interviewing two potential users of the website, the most relevant things that I learnt that lead me to create the low fidelity prototype that can be
                                found on this page are that one of the things that the website needs to have for sure is a subpage that has 
                                all available resources at Carleton that pertain to mental health, page in which one could look for vaguely what resource they want access to and the 
                                page will provide what it thinks you are looking for. The other thing I learn is that there should be some specific resources when one opens the page 
                                particularly those that help first gen students and international students, since they are the most likely to be affected by lack of information 
                                in regards to the available resources at school.

                            As can be inferred from the previous paragraph our project went through a couple iterations of research, we each conducted 2  interviews, mainly they were semi-structured interviews, 
                            however some of us decided to use fictional inquiry, for a total of 10 interviews.
                            These reason why I decided to use semi-structured interviews is because even if there is an outline that was created before them that I mostly followed,
                            this outline was created with the idea in mind that we (as interviewers) would stray from the outline and allows for more or different questions to be asked based off what the interviewees answered.
                            These interviews where then used to create a codebook which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1toB4XXmeew5NoEOCJIe6C46lZ4W6x21atgiLAaFYGDo/edit?usp=sharing" class="blue">here</a>, 
                            this codebook was used to then <abbr title="research technique in which relationships between categories and codes are analysed">axial-code</abbr> the interviews. This initial axial-coding helped us create the
                            affinity diagram that you can see in this section which has the different codes that we all individually thought that the page should have. Thus from this affinity diagram we were able to create a codebook that 
                            we used to make a final round of axial-coding with.
                            The reason for why we had so many steps is that from this final axial-coding we were able to generate the main requirements that our website has, which then influenced the way that we would create our next individual prototypes.

                                Now you may be wondering, <b>what are our main requirements then?</b><br>
                                Well I am glad you asked, I will only talk about the ones that we as a time decided were the 3 most important and thus we all individually used
                                to create our own version 2 prototypes for the website. <br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Counseling options/Scheduling: List of counseling options and how to schedule them since students are not fully aware on how to. 
                                        In this case we mention the need to provide a step by step list however I decided that for my prototype I wanted to show an option in which
                                        the student access an item on the navigation bar and when selecting a day all the possible options appear since I believe that while we might not be able 
                                        to accomplish this in the amount of time that we have available for this project, because of the second requirement and because
                                        this is a prototype design I wanted to explore a different approach that could be implemented by the college in the future 
                                        or by us where we to continue working on this project.

                                Common Q&As: List considering of common questions and pieces of misinformation that the student body might have and the answers 
                                to those inquiries. I decided to add a search bar to the design*, because based off of the interviews there is a lot of topics 
                                that there might be misconceptions off and thus a lot of questions that might need answering.
                            </li>
                            <li>Resource Directory: A list with all mental health resources. This is done so that in case that a student wants to look for a resource but they
                                do not know which office it belongs to, this page has a search function<a class="blue">*</a> where they can look for it even if they are not sure of the specific name.

                                     hours in a given day and will continue to do so until it is unclicked (ideally it would change per day, but I could not figure it out), inspired by the mySHAC schedule a counseling appointment subpage.
