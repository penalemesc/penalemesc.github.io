                    and to be potentially used as a platform for game development

                                (as specified in the tutorial for creating it, which can be found 
                                <a href="https://makerspace.cc/Carl-o-gotchi_(Project_0046)" class="blue">here</a>),
                                the model presented does not have battery capabilites because the board that connects everything together is not fully populated 
                                with the required circuitry.

                               Thus having built the original model over the summer, this term I decided I wanted to finally give it a battery, in this article 
                               you will find both a full tutorial on how to make it and add the battery and an exploration on how the experience on how I added the battery
                               and all the modifications that I had to do in order for it to work, along with plenty prototypes! The one that should be autoplaying at the moment next to this 
                               is an extra that I built to gift to someone who said that they wanted the dog to be named Buddy and that is why it does not have the normal

                                    If you haven't, open the protective film of the ESP32S2 and grab 2 of the rows of pins and put them 
                                    in the custom PCB in the outermost rows for both the bottom side and top side (another explanation: 
                                    there are 4 rows for pins, put them in the ones that are the furthes from eachother), making sure 
                                    that the black separator that they have is in the same side of the board as where we put the solder 
                                    connections for the buttons and that the longest side of the pins go towards where the clicking part of the buttons are
                                    and solder them from this last side (so the one with the clickers)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    With a pair of cutters remove the excess pin that is left after soldering, as close to the solder 
                                    point as possible as this way we get a better look on the bottom side and so that the screen can be properly
                                    placed on the board, which is comming next
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    (If the screen does not come with its pins soldered to it already then) Solder the short pins to the screen, so the 
                                    ones that are short from the black divider, making sure they are parallel to the screen or as much as they can as 
                                    this might affect the fit of the whole thing (this is why its good that a lot of the time these screens come with the pins soldered to them)

                                    with the screen down on the surface, with this we place the ESP32S2 with the USB C connector on the left side of the custom PCB (following the lines 
                                    that are layed out in the board essentially)

                    With this we are done with the hardware side of the basic board and we can move on to the software and you may be wondering, shouldn't we be 
                    doing the battery? And the answer is <b>NO!</b> The reason for that is that we want to do software first as that way we can make sure that we have 
                    not burnt any connections when we were soldering and the only way to do this is through uploading the software! <b>It is important that you do not 
                    connect the board to anything yet</b>, for now leave it as is until it is mentioned that you can/should connect it to the computer

                                    of ESP32S2 or Lolin S2 mini, etc, there are plenty options, but essentially you want the name of a board there and it should be some variation of the one we are using

                            We are now <i>technically </i>done with software, if you want to grab the MAC address for the board (for WI-FI purposes for example in the case of Carleton, where you need it for <a href="https://clearpass1.carleton.edu/guest/auth_login.php?target=%2Fguest%2Fmac_list.php" class="blue">network registration</a>)
                            then you can go onto the Arduino terminal and scroll all the way up and MAC should be listed there.<br>
                            However if you want to make sure (and you should make sure), click the RST button that is on the opposite side of the board from the On button, it says RST below it.
                            If everything went on correctly then the screen will start displaying the background of the project along with the name that we chose for our Carl-o-Gotchi
                            (essentially what is shown when I turn it on towards the end of the video at the start of this page), it should take a couple of seconds, if it takes a couple of minutes this is likely that the WI-FI is not properly set up
                            as there is code that needs it so I would try to set it up again and download the code onto the board again.
