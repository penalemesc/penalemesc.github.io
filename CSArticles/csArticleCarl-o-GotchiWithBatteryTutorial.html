                    College]
                    Class of '69 Makerspace. It is meant as an instructional project for the Makerspace that teaches
                    students how to solder
                    and to be potentially used as a platform for game development

                                In regards to the second question of why I added a battery to it, that would be because
                                the current project
                                (as specified in the tutorial for creating it, which can be found
                                <a href="https://makerspace.cc/Carl-o-gotchi_(Project_0046)" class="blue">here</a>),
                                the model presented does not have battery capabilities because the board that connects
                                everything together is not fully populated
                                with the required circuitry.

                                Thus having built the original model over the summer, this term I decided I wanted to
                                finally give it a battery, in this article
                                you will find both a full tutorial on how to make it and add the battery and an
                                exploration on how the experience on how I added the battery
                                and all the modifications that I had to do in order for it to work, along with plenty
                                prototypes! The one that should be auto playing at the moment next to this
                                is an extra that I built to gift to someone who said that they wanted the dog to be
                                named Buddy and that is why it does not have the normal
                                "Carl-o-Gotchi" text on boot.

                                    From the side where the clicking part of the button are, put the resistance (on what
                                    would be the space for it on the opposite side of where the marking for it is),
                                    making it so that the legs go to the same side
                                    as the legs of the buttons, twist them so that they are easier to solder. Solder
                                    them and cut off the excess with the cutter, making it as close to the solder joint
                                    as possible, as the beeper is going to go on top of it

                                If you haven't, open the protective film of the ESP32S2 and grab 2 of the rows of pins

                                in the custom PCB in the outermost rows for both the bottom side and top side (another
                                explanation:
                                there are 4 rows for pins, put them in the ones that are the furthest from each other),
                                making sure
                                that the black separator that they have is in the same side of the board as where we put

                                connections for the buttons and that the longest side of the pins go towards where the
                                clicking part of the buttons are
                                and solder them from this last side (so the one with the clickers)

                                point as possible as this way we get a better look on the bottom side and so that the
                                screen can be properly
                                placed on the board, which is coming next

                                (If the screen does not come with its pins soldered to it already then) Solder the short
                                pins to the screen, so the
                                ones that are short from the black divider, making sure they are parallel to the screen
                                or as much as they can as
                                this might affect the fit of the whole thing (this is why its good that a lot of the
                                time these screens come with the pins soldered to them)

                                    Put the ESP32S2 on top of the pins that we had laid out towards the start, making
                                    sure that we have the custom PCB placed on a flat surface
                                    with the screen down on the surface, with this we place the ESP32S2 with the USB C
                                    connector on the left side of the custom PCB (following the lines
                                    that are laid out in the board essentially)

                    With this we are done with the hardware side of the basic board and we can move on to the software
                    and you may be wondering, shouldn't we be
                    doing the battery? And the answer is <b>NO!</b> The reason for that is that we want to do software
                    first as that way we can make sure that we have
                    not burnt any connections when we were soldering and the only way to do this is through uploading
                    the software! <b>It is important that you do not
                        connect the board to anything yet</b>, for now leave it as is until it is mentioned that you
                    can/should connect it to the computer

                                Make sure that On button on the ESP32S2 board is placed correctly, if you placed the
                                board correctly, assuming the screen is at the top
                                (so furthest from you if you place it with the screen on a y axis)
                                then the On button should be at the bottom, you can tell if it is because it does not
                                have the letters RST below or above it,
                                if the button is not there, then that means you put it on the wrong way, thus you should
                                remove all the solder joints, turn it so
                                that it is there (with the USB C connector at the top) and solder again.

                                    With Arduino IDE open, connect the USB Cable to your computer <b>not to the
                                        board</b>,
                                    press the On button on the board, you are going to want to keep holding this button
                                    as you plug in the cable to the board
                                    at least until you have verified the next step, the reason for that is that this
                                    action puts the
                                    board into download mode, which allows us to upload programs onto it!

                                    you might be asked if you want to connect
                                    to that, click yes), on the top left of the Arduino IDE you will see a dark drop
                                    down menu, it should have text that says some variation
                                    of ESP32S2 or Lolin S2 mini, etc, there are plenty options, but essentially you want
                                    the name of a board there and it should be some variation of the one we are using
                                </li>
                                <li>Click the upload button (the arrow that is to the left of where we checked for the

                            the board (for WI-FI purposes for example in the case of Carleton, where you need it for <a

                            then you can go onto the Arduino terminal and scroll all the way up and MAC should be listed
                            there.<br>
                            However if you want to make sure (and you should make sure), click the RST button that is on
                            the opposite side of the board from the On button, it says RST below it.

                            likely that the WI-FI is not properly set up
                            as there is code that needs it so I would try to set it up again and download the code onto

                            brains of the device and all of it is connected on one single body
                            <li>If the battery has a special connector at the tip of the cables, remove it, the cables
                                should have the electrically conducting part of the wire at the tip

                                the B+ since that is the first one we are going to solder)

                                you on the table or soldering station and the battery should be on the table or a
                                surface, with the cables being on top of the board without soldering them yet

                <h4>Congrats!</h4>
                You have just finished your very own "Carl-o-Gotchi" you are now invited to modify the software as much
                as your heart desires, make some new games! Change the sprites in some way! Add functionality to the
                beeper (because that has not been coded yet)!
                <br>
                Now you might be thinking, Conrado, I read this whole tutorial and the only mention of a prototype was a single image before a warning,
                how did you prototype? What did you prototype?<br>
                Well the answers to these questions are simple, I had to first prototype a way to get the new
                electronics connected, to do this I asked Aaron about how to do it, he pointed me to a student worker at
                the makerspace who had experience with these technologies and this student told me a similar version of what is written here, though to
                to corroborate I also did a google search where after exploring multiple articles where people were
                wondering the same question, I arrived at the same conclusion that the student had given me so it
                became a case of figuring out how to place the new electronics on the case.
                <br>
                It is the case that the original design for the case is not mine, it was created by Aaron and I really
                liked it because he designed it with a battery in mind even if it would then not be added until me,
                however what happened with this case is that due to the added height brought on by the charging board,
                the electronics would not fit inside of it, both because there was no hole for the slider switch but
                also because the electronics were much to tall.
                <br>
                Thus what I did was go through a couple of iterations of backer case, where I would slowly modify it
                based on how I had set up the electronics inside. I must also admit that even though the idea might not
                have gotten across before, it is the case that I had to reorganise the insides a couple of times, for
                example, originally the PCB of the charging board was on top of the USB connector of the ESP32S2 rather
                than how it is now where the ports of both are almost touching. So both parts were sort of built at the
                same time, as I moved the electronics the case was modified a bit and as I figured out the case the
                electronics were moved, it essentially built on itself.
                <br>

                <p>
                    I think the most important part of this project it is that it was fun to build and prototype! I
                    think that while there were things that potentially were frustrating, such as the couple of hours I
                    spent racking my brain around why my board would not turn on anymore or even connect to my laptop
                    when it was working perfectly fine the day before, when in reality what had happened is that I had
                    burnt the ESP32S2 by connecting it to my computer at the same time as the battery was on. Which is
                    why now there is a big note about it!
                    <br>
                    But even that which was a bit frustrating was fun in the end because it led me to experiment on
                    different possibilities and do a lot of research on why things might stop working so yeah I would
                    rate this project a 10/10! Hopefully in the future I can come back to it and create new sprites and
                    other fun additions to it!
                    <br>
                    And now I leave you with a picture of the 5 or so iterations for a back plate that were created for
                    this project, the original is on the left and the finished version is on the right with all the in
                    betweens in the middle.
