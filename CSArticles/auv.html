                    You might be here from the update from my LinkedIn post in which I presented the fact
                    that from March 2025 to August 2025 I worked for the Computer Science department at Carleton College as
                    a student researcher. 
                    <br> <br>
                    If you are not, well then that is the short version of it! In this post I will present some more information
                    than the one I presented in the original post that I did on LinkedIn. It is important to note however, with the
                    project that I worked on still being a work in progress, I cannot go into as much detail as one would have liked.
                    It is also why I took so long to present this here and LinkedIn as it is a delicate matter as it is subject to 
                    change from what I worked on.

                                Let us start with the basics, <strong>What is an AUV?</strong> AUV or Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, for its 
                                disambiguation, is a type of robot whose main purpose is that it works underwater without any 
                                human input (that's why its autonomous). To do this, it uses a combination of techniques to seal
                                everything together to prevent water from getting in and frying everything. These techniques are 
                                are mixture of chemical and mechanical assembly work that make it possible to have computing capable 
                                equipment under the strain that water normally puts on components.
                            </p>
                            <h5>What are they used for? And why do we care that they are Autonomous?</h5>
                            <p>These types of robot have many uses, from deep sea and cave exploration, military applications like disarming
                                old underwater mines, to things like marine life surveilance, where you leave an AUV to gather data about the 
                                fish that exist in the area. <br> A lot of times the main reason why we care for them to be autonomous is due to time.
                                Assume that you have an area of 1.5 square kilometres (about a mile, for those that use the imperial system), 
                                with a human input you can only get data for a given amount of time, assume that they are scuba divers, then at some point they need to 
                                change oxigen or Nitrox tanks and even if you have someone to keep supplying them from a boat then you still face the possibility of dehydration
                                and hypothermia. With an AUV on the other hand, if you give it a big enough battery life, you can drop it off in the area and come back in 
                                however long its battery will last. Some being a couple hours, some a couple of days all on a single charge, which allows for continuous monitoring 
                                over the entire time.

                        <h5>What is the point of making one for the school? And why did you work on it?</h5>
                        <p>The main purpose of the project was to create a Low Cost AUV, much like the one done by the University Of Minnesota a couple years prior. The reason
                            for this is that normally AUV's cost tens of thousands of dollars, with U$D70000 being considered cheap for one. Thus our goal
                            was to build one that could be built for a lot less than that, so that the technology would not be left only in the hands of 
                            research institutions, but rather be something that hobbyiest could get their hands on for not an exhorbitant amount. <br> It is important thus to note that 
                            there exists a similar technology to AUV's called ROV (or Remotely Operated Vehicle for its disambiguation). These tend to cost around the U$D5000, which
                            is a lot less than the cheapest AUV, however they have the disavantage that they need to be connected to a controller and thus cannot be left alone 
                            if you drop this into the ocean, turn it on, leave and come back in 3 hours it will be in the exact same spot (provided nothing happens obviously), if you do the 
                            same with an AUV, it might be in the same spot if you set it to act that way, however in that time it could have gone around in a determined area and gotten all the data
                            that it needed. This difference is why we built ours, we want to be able to make the process of building an AUV simpler and cheaper. <br>
