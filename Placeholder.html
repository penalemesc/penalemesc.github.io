CampusCare is a website developed by <b>Team ACME</b>, composed by <b>A</b>nika Rajbhandary, <b>M</b>ustafe Osman, <b>C</b>onrado Pe√±a Lemes (me!)
                    and <b>E</b>lla Visconti, who are students of CS 344 - Human Computer Interactions
                    at Carleton College in Northfield, Minesotta, United States of America. <br> The goal of the website is to centralise mental health and wellness
                    resources at Carleton as they are not always easy to access and even when they are easy to access, students might not know they are available
                    since there are multiple websites that handle all different parts of the resources available here at Carleton. <br> As such Team ACME's goal is to 
                    have at the very least an easy way to access all the different resources that might be available such as counceling sessions, the SWA dogs, 
                    religious services, etcetera. <br><br>
                    From interviewing two potential users of the website, the most relevant things that I learnt that lead me to create the low fidelity prototype that can be
                    found on this page are that one of the things that the website needs to have for sure is a subpage that has 
                    all available resources at Carleton that pertain to mental health, page in which one could look for vaguely what resource they want access to and the 
                    page will provide what it thinks you are looking for. The other thing I learn is that there should be some specific resources when one opens the page 
                    particularly those that help first gen students and international students, since they are the most likely to be affected by lack of information 
                    in regards to the available resources at school.
