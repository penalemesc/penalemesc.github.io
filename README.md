Personal website created over the course of winter 2025 for CS344 - Human Computer Interactions 
Template for website was acquiared from https://w3layouts.com/template-category/free-website-template/

Information on how the banner works was found after going through the javascript and realising it uses owlCaousel
https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/basic.html 

Once done designing the navbar in the index page, copy it and replace it on all the pages as otherwise it will not look good

Page headers are defined in css, under .page-header

For the about page, main picture linkedin one, then one with the suit and then the two small ones some fun things like 
a goofy one or something I have taken
