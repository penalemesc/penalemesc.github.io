Personal website created over the course of winter 2025 for CS344 - Human Computer Interactions 
Template for website was acquiared from https://w3layouts.com/template-category/free-website-template/

Information on how the banner works was found after going through the javascript and realising it uses owlCaousel
https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/basic.html 

Once done designing the navbar in the index page, copy it and replace it on all the pages as otherwise it will not look good

Page headers are defined in css, under .page-header

Banner slider in the home page messages: "Website is under construction" "Want to learn more about my hci project? Click here!" "Want to learn about me?" "Here's what I have been up to with photography!"

The way I should go about designing the photography pages is through the product html and have a couple of featured ones and then make a list of sorts where I have all the other pages that have my projects, I should write about 3 even if right now ive only done 2 big ones, and the way each individual page should be is with a custom made template that I will create where I have some of the pictures and descriptions of how the project came to be, all the things that were used and have it be in a sort of snake pattern 

Section title class creates the line with a dot in the about
