Personal website created over the course of winter 2025 for CS344 - Human Computer Interactions 
Template for website was acquiared from https://w3layouts.com/template-category/free-website-template/

Information on how the banner works was found after going through the javascript and realising it uses owlCaousel
https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/basic.html 

Once done designing the navbar in the index page, copy it and replace it on all the pages as otherwise it will not look good
